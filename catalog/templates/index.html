    <h2>Tool Sharing</h2>
    <p>We all have a garage, shed and/or workroom filled with tools we got for a project
        and then never needed again? Instead of each having our own lawn mower, snow
        blower, leaf blower and extension ladders? Thatâ€™s a lot of stuff, which takes up a
        lot of space, and costs quite a bit of money! Before you buy more equipment for
        your next house project, consider joining your neighbors tool sharing.</p>



    <h3>Tool list</h3>
    <p>The Tool Shed has <a href="{% url 'tools' %}">the following tools</a> in inventory.
